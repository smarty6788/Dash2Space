### Disclaimer

I am not the original maker of this theme, rather this is a fork. I have taken a snippet from ModernX-Theme and just made it into a theme. If the owner of ModernX wishes for this theme to be taken down, then so have it.

*Do not bother the original author if **my** fork has a problem. Make an issue here on Github or contact me via Discord.*
