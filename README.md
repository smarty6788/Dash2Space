I am not the original maker of this theme, rather this is a fork. The original author of this theme is currently inactive, so I chose to maintain it myself. If the original author wants the theme taken down, I will gladly comply.

*Do not bother the original author if **my** fork has a problem. Make an issue here on Github or contact me via Discord.*
